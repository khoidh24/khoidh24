# I am Veinz 🌿

As a computer enthusiast from a very early age, I’ve always had a strong passion for sitting in front of a screen and creating applications for users. This passion was further reinforced after I completed my university studies and gained exposure to various corporate environments, working alongside highly qualified **Front-end developers** and **UI/UX designers**.

***Where art and logic meet*** — This is the perfect description of the Front-end role I chose as the first step in my journey as a programmer. My goal is to build applications that are both functional and visually engaging, aiming to delight users every time they interact with them.

In the future, I aspire to become an **All-rounded developer** — someone who understands and controls the architecture of an entire system. With this knowledge, I believe I can provide more efficient, faster, and highly effective solutions.

## Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working at **Estuary Solutions**
- ⚡ My current position is **Junior Front-end Developer**
- 🎓 I graduated from the **University of Greenwich Vietnam** with a **Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering**
- 🧠 I have **2 years of experience** in Frontend Development
