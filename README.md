# I am Veinz ðŸŒ¿
As a computer enthusiast from a very early age, Iâ€™ve always had a strong passion for sitting in front of a screen and creating applications for users. This passion was further reinforced after I completed my university studies and gained exposure to various corporate environments, working alongside highly qualified **Front-end developers** and **UI/UX designers**.

***Where art and logic meet*** â€” This is the perfect description of the Front-end role I chose as the first step in my journey as a programmer. My goal is to build applications that are both functional and visually engaging, aiming to delight users every time they interact with them.

In the future, I aspire to become an **All-rounded developer** â€” someone who understands and controls the architecture of an entire system. With this knowledge, I believe I can provide more efficient, faster, and highly effective solutions.

## Here are some ideas to get you started:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at **Estuary Solutions**
- âš¡ My current position is **Junior Front-end Developer**
- ðŸŽ“ I graduated from the **University of Greenwich Vietnam** with a **Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering â€“ Second Class**
- ðŸ”Ž You can contact me via: **hoangkhoiduong24@gmail.com**
